contact between your computer and us in the past and to identify the
most popular sections of the EMFI Website.
</p>
<p>
Where available, the “Cookies Policy” link at the bottom of the page
gives you more details about EMFI’s use of cookies, and lets you
control which types of cookies the EMFI Website may set on your device
(known as your “cookie settings”). Please ensure that you set your

from another browser or device your cookie settings may be lost. To
comply with applicable laws and regulations, in some countries you may
be asked to confirm your cookie settings when you first visit the EMFI
Website. If you are in a country where you are automatically required
to set your cookie settings, you may be asked to set them again on a
future visit.
</p>
<p>
In many cases you can also control tracking technologies using your
browser. Please ensure that your browser setting reflects whether you
wish to be warned about and/or accept tracking technologies (such as
cookies) where possible. The specific capabilities of your browser and
instructions on how to use them can usually be found in the manual or
help file of your browser.

affiliates, agents and third-party providers who have access to
personal data obtained through the EMFI Website are obliged to respect
privacy.
</p>
<p>
When transferring personal data internationally we make sure that we
comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example, by entering
into agreements which will ensure that the recipients of your
information maintain an adequate level of data protection.
</p>
<p>
We may also disclose your information to governmental agencies or
entities, regulatory authorities, or other persons in line with any
